This directory contains a Tkinter application to help test the gpiozero4mqtt class. 

It can interact with any MQTT server.



The application needs an XML subdirectory to receive the XMLs from the Raspberry Pi using the gpiozero4mqtt library. It also needs a log directory.



This is my first Tkinter application ... and my first mqtt tester ... in a new language ... python !
