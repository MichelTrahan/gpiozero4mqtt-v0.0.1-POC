This directory has the following files:

	clsLog.py
	Raspi_Info.py
	RPi_I2C_driver.py

	gpiozero4mqtt.py
	SourceConnectionProcessor.py

The clsLog.py is used to create multiple log files if needed in one application.

The Raspi_Info.py creates dictionaries used with JSON to get the health of a Raspberry Pi that uses the gpiozero4mqtt library.

TPi_I2C_driver.py is used for lcd processing.

The main workhorse is gpiozero4mqtt.py which process the XML and the MQTT messages.

The SourceConnectionProcessor.py is ... used to process the source parameters of the gpiozero widgets, using XML ... this is text base but it works ...

Some of you might say ... hey why not create a module ... this is my first python project ... and I had to learn python, mqtt, tkinter, gpiozero ...
