This directory contains the files that you need to have on the second Raspberry Pi of the sample project.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The XML file contains 3 types of information.

	1- The IP of the MQTT server and the port used as well as the quality of service asked for. and how long to keep the connection alive.

	2- The list of what is connected to the Raspberry pi, in this case 4 LEDs (Blue1, Red1, Yellow1, Green1) using the minimum XML declaration that uses all the default parameters for the LEDs, as defined in the gpiozero library. 

	3- The list of things connected using their source attributes. None in the sample.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PIOT_Controller_Modified.py file contains the minimum code needed to use the gpiozero4mqtt library. 

The minimum code is as follows:

	1- You either instantiate the class with it's default XML filename and location or, give the XML as an argument to the Controller. 

	2- You connect to the MQTT server

	3- Start the MQTT_Client loop

	4- in an infinite loop, check if some widgets in the gpioList needs processing (Distance Sensor, 4x4 Keypad)

	5- check if a keyboard interrupt was asked ... if so, disconnect for the MQTT server and stop the loop

But if you want to react to some events from some other raspberry pi connected to the same MQTT server, you need to add 3 things to the controller code.

	A- One function per event you want to react to ... in this case, when the BigButton1 is either Pressed, Held, or Released, I want to light up some LED to show the event occured. So there are 3 functions to program.

	B- Use a message_callback_Add function call to add each one of the newly defined functions, 3 in our case.

	C- Subscribe to the events from the BigButton1
